6 types of Bean scopes in spring framework

1. singleton
When we define a bean with the singleton scope, the container creates a single instance of that bean;
all requests for that bean name will return the same object, which is cached.
Any modifications to the object will be reflected in all references to the bean.
This scope is the default value if no other scope is specified.

2. prototype
A bean with the prototype scope will return a different instance every time it is requested from the container.
It is defined by setting the value prototype to the @Scope annotation in the bean definition

3. request
4. session
5. application
6. websocket

among the 6 these ones are only available in a web-aware application which are: request, session, application and websocket
